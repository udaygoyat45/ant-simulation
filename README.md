# ant-simulation

An Ant Simulation inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A. 
I found the particle simulation in the video really awesome, and someone also recommnended me to learn Rust. 
I first implemented this in python, but unfortunately, PyGame coulnd't handle that many ants.
I used GGEZ and implemented all the physics and collision detection myself. I attempted to use rayon for parallelization.
